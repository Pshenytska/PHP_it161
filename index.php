  <h2 class="subheader">Why do I study web development and design?</h2>
  <p>With the advent of pandemic COVID-19, a lot of new online platforms like “Cyber Security in two weeks” or “Hebrew in one month” appeared on the Internet. Most of them will never replace traditional education since their inherent goals seem to only be in profits and feeding their economical bottom line. That is why I want to become an intricate member of a UX Design and Research team in decent online educational platforms, which make a valuable impact on a frenetic online education.</p>
  <p>My major inspirational UX coach-expert, which I look up to, is Andrew Doherty - his sincere passion for products and real-life experiences from working at McDonald's up to Google - makes me feel more confident about the way I would like to go about implementing my own work.</p>
  <p>I am confident that the Web Dev and Design programs at Seattle Central will be a great start but not the last step in my educational path. I am looking forward to expanding my professionalism by getting additional education in human-computer interaction and psychology at UW University.</p>
